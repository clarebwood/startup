This will be deleted later.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Here are two things I have noticed about myself: I love getting to look back at my own statistics, and I am *very* emotional. So why not combine the two? I think it be fun to create a website that allows people to track and look back on their daily emotions. This website would allow users to select what they believe to be their strongest emotion of the day once each day. They can then go back and see what their daily emotions have been as time goes on. They can also see what the weather looked like that day, because weather can play a big part in how you are feeling on any given day. In addition to this, users would be able to check out the dayâ€™s most commonly chosen emotions based on what was logged by the entire community.

### Design

![Sketch](rough_sketch.jpg)

This is a *very* rough idea of what the website might look like. There would be a page for registering and logging in, a page for choosing the day's emotion, a page showing the day's most popular emotion, and a page showing the user's history. I would like to have a hamburger type of menu to navigate from page to page, but I'm not dead set on it. The emotions would be shown as cute little faces, or possibly just regular old emojis. History would be shown as one calendar-looking screen with the emotion picture and weather symbol shown on each day. All this is what I came up with without really understanding anything, so it is all subject to major changes.

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Ability to select an emotion daily
- Display of selected emotions for previous days as well as the weather that day
- Display of holidays instead of weather with previous emotions if the weather idea doesn't work
- Display of most selected emotion of all users for the current day updated in realtime
- Notification when other users pick a daily emotion if the most common emotion idea doesn't work
- Accounts, emotions, and weather data is stored

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Four HTML pages. One for login, one for emotion selction, one for history, and one for the daily common emotion.
- **CSS** - Application styling that is readable, cute, and looks good regardless of screensize.
- **React** - Provides login, emotion selector, displaying past selections and weather, displaying daily popular emotion, and use of React for routing and components.  
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - register, login, and log out
  - saving daily emotions and weather
  - retrieving previous emotions and weather
  - retrieving daily popular emotion
  - retrieving weather data from a third party
- **DB/Login** - Store users, emotions, and weather data in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Cannot log emotion unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each user logs an emotion, the most chosen emotion for the current day is updated live and shown to all users.
